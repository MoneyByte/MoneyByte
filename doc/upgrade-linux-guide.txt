:::: Upgrading on Ubuntu / Debian Linux Distributions ::::

Your default data directory is ~/.MoneyByte - This folder contains your wallet*, the chain data, and your configuration files
To backup and clean this folder, do this:
`cd ~/.MoneyByte`

You will now be in the data directory. From here, you want to copy out your wallet and important files.
First, make a backup folder,
`mkdir ~/moneybytebackup`

Then, copy the important files to your backup:
`cp wallet.dat ~/moneybytebackup && cp *.conf ~/moneybytebackup`

Now, you can delete the data directory,
`cd ~/ && rm -r ~/.MoneyByte`

The folder that contained your data is now deleted. Now, you can compile MoneyByteCoin like usual,
`mkdir ~/MoneyByteCoinsource && cd ~/MoneyByteBlockchainsource && git clone https://github.com/MoneyByte/MoneyByteBlockchain && cd MoneyByteBlockchain/src && make -f makefile.unix`

Then, you want to copy your compiled moneybyted from ~/Msource/MoneyByteBlockchain/bin to /usr/local/bin, make sure you remove it if it was already there first, by doing:
`sudo rm /usr/local/bin/moneybyted && cp ~/MoneyByteBlockchainsource/MoneyByteBlockchain/bin/moneybyted /usr/local/bin`

Once it is compiled and installed, you can then restore the data directory. Run moneybyted to initialize the directory,
`moneybyted`

Then, copy the backed up wallet and configuration files into the new data directory, with:
`cp ~/moneybytebackup/* ~/.MoneyByte`

Now, run moneybyted again, and your all set , with old wallet and configurations. Just wait for sync and your upgraded!
